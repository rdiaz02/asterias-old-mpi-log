Some genes are constant for all samples. This leads to variances = 0 and is probably not what you want. Please remove these genes and try again. The genes with constat values are in positions  1

 Some genes have as many missings as the size  of the smallest class minus 1. This is not allowed  because you can end up with samples of size 1 for  one class in some permutations.

Some genes are constant for all samples. This leads to variances = 0 and is probably not what you want. Please remove these genes and try again. The genes with constat values are in positions  1
